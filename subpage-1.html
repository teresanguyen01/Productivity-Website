    <p>Dealing with procrastination can be difficult as there are many distractions in our lives like phones, activities, etc. To deal with procrastination, one must find what the problem is. For example, if you spend too much time on your phone, you must figure out how to fix that issue, like turning off your phone. I used to have a problem with procrastination, and I realized that I spent too much time scrolling through social media and watching YouTube. To deal with this problem, I turned off the WiFi on my phone. Getting rid of distractions is the first step to solving the procrastination problem.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another way to remove procrastination is to find the motivation to do homework. Homework can be a pain, but if you find a way to enjoy doing your homework, avoiding procrastination is easier. I did not enjoy homework, but I found a “fun” way to do homework, using multiple colors and highlighters for my work. It made my work more pleasing to look at, as well as motivate me to do work. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Furthermore, making a list or a schedule can make your life more organized. If you make a list, stick to that plan, you are more likely to get your work done on time. Keeping a calendar near your workplace is a helpful reminder to get your job done when you want. </p>
