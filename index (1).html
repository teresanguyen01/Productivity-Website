    <p> Preview Procrastination: Dealing with procrastination can be difficult as there are many distractions in our lives like phones, activities, etc. To deal with procrastination, one must find what the problem is. For example, if you spend too much time on your phone, you must figure out how to fix that issue, like turning off your phone. I used to have a problem with procrastination, and I realized that I spent too much time scrolling through social media and watching YouTube. To deal with this problem, I turned off the WiFi on my phone. Getting rid of distractions is the first step to solving the procrastination problem. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Preview Studying: The first thing that I highly recommend you do is to find a quiet place to study. Studying in a noisy area can distract your brain’s thinking process, and you can get sidetracked in other people’s conversations if you are studying in a noisy area. </p>
