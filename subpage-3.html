    <p>Wellness is essential in your overall mentality and enjoyment in life. To have a closer look at wellness, here a diagram which shows the <strong> Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.</strong> You don't want to spend your whole life studying, so you have to make time for yourself and use it wisely. Also, you don't want to give too much time for yourself as you will be overwhelmed with homework later on. For example, if you were to spend all of your time playing video games, you would not have enough time with homework. If you were to spend all your time doing homework, you would be overwhelmed and stressed out. To solve this problem, you should portion out your time to have time for both. For example, if you were to switch between one-hour studying and a fifteen-minute break, you would be productive and awake during your homework. Even though you may enjoy playing video games, try using your fifteen-minute break to keep your brain alive. For instance, napping, sudoku, word puzzles, etc. can help keep your mind awake and happy. After finishing your homework, you should also try to be productive. Meditating, taking a walk around the neighborhood, and exercising can help you have a productive and happy life. </p>
