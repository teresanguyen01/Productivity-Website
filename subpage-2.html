    <p>The first thing that I highly recommend you do is to find a quiet place to study. Studying in a noisy area can distract your brain’s thinking process, and you can get sidetracked in other people’s conversations if you are studying in a noisy area.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>Once you have found where you want to study, clean out/organize your area. Considering in a cluttered area makes you focus on clearing out your area, so it can get you sidetracked. Clean your area ahead of time, so that way you won’t distract your homework time. The scent of your space can also affect your studying time, so light a beautifully scented candle in your room.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lastly, play some soothing music like lofi, instrumental, or piano on your phone, speaker, or don’t listen to music if that’s your preference. I tend to stay away from music with lyrics or wild beats because it distracts me from studying.</p>
